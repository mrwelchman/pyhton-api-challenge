My philosophy regarding these assignments is, while it's nice to meet deadlines, I'd rather nail the material than hit a deadline. That being said, I nailed the material.

Be sure to add your own API keys into a basic api key .py file. Below is something you can quickly copy and paste upin creating the file.

# OpenWeatherMap API Key
weather_api_key = "PUT THAT KEY HERE"

# Google API Key
g_key = "GIMME THAT KEY YOU VILLAIN"
